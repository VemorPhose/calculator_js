A basic calculator built as a test for implementing JavaScript.

Floating point arithmethic is very wonky as a result of JavaScript dealing with numbers exclusively in the "double" format, and due to the fact that I got tired of bug fixing and couldn't be bothered to implement a string-to-integer interchanging system to do the arithmetic instead.

Hopefully will fix other bugs soon enough 🙏
